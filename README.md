# VSCode-Portfolio Clone

This is a small portfolio project inspired by the look and feel of Visual Studio Code.
It’s not my official portfolio — just a creative side project I wanted to build after seeing similar ideas online.

## Purpose

I wanted to recreate the VSCode aesthetic to showcase my skills and developer journey in a more tech-friendly and original way.

## Tech Stack

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Configurable for Vercel, Netlify, or other platforms

## Important Note

This project is not responsive, so it’s best viewed on desktop only.

## Disclaimer

This is not my real portfolio — just a personal experiment to explore coding and UI design inspired by a dev environment.
